# Apocalypse Island

## Overview

Apocalypse Island is a colony-building survival game set during a zombie apocalypse. The game
follows a group of survivors who escape a nearby infected city to an uninhabited island. The
survivors will collect resources and build a settlement on the island. The island provides a safe
space where survivors can extract resources, farm, and build. Certain resources, however, can only
be found in the city that the survivors left. The player can organize scavenging missions that will
send survivors back to the city to acquire these resources. Scavenging missions will also feature
events that may involve increased risk but can lead to rewards such as additional resources or new
survivors joining the settlement. Events may also advance the game's story.
